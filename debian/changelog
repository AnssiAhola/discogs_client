python-discogs-client (2.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial release. (Closes: #961714)
  * The official "Python client for the Discogs API" was deprecated by
    discogs.com as of June 2020. This active fork of the client incorporates
    the following new features:
  * Support adding releases to the user's collection folders.
  * The "Discogs ratelimit headers" are now accessible through the client, which
    finally enables developers to take care of limitting requests to the API
    accordingly and thus prevent "Too many requests errors".
  * Support "Discogs lists" (https://www.discogs.com/lists),
    either through direct access or through the user model.
