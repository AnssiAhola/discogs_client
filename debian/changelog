python-discogs-client (2.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial release. (Closes: #961714)
  * The official "Python client for the Discogs API" was deprecated by
    discogs.com as of June 2020. This active fork of the client incorporates
    the following new features:
  * Support adding releases to the user's collection folders.
  * The "Discogs ratelimit headers" are now accessible through the client,
    which enables developers to take care of limitting requests to the API
    accordingly and thus prevent "Too many requests errors".
  * Support "Discogs lists" (https://www.discogs.com/lists),
    either through direct access or through the user model.
